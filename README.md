## How to play
The game randomly generates a five-letter word, and you have to guess it in six attempts.

Every time you make an attempt, the cell color will change and indicate how close you are to the correct word.

Colors guide:
- ***Green square***: indicates a letter that is correct and in the right position.
- ***Yellow circle***: indicates a letter that is correct but in the wrong position.
- ***Gray square***: indicates a letter that is not correct.

> The word list only includes Spanish words.
